   * - value — Points to an implementation of the entrypoint. See below for the default JVM notation.

   * If an entrypoint does not need to specify a language adapter other than the default language adapter, the entrypoint can be represented simply as the value string instead.
   *
   * ### JVM entrypoint notation
   *
   * When referring to a class, the binary name is used. An example of a binary name is `my.mod.MyClass$Inner`.
   *
   * One of the following `value` notations may be used in the JVM notation:
   *
   * - Implementation onto a class
   *   - The value must contain a fully qualified binary name to the class.
   *   - Implementing class must extend or implement the entrypoint interface.
   *   - Class must have a no-argument public constructor.
   *   - Example: example.mod.MainModClass
   * - A field inside of a class.
   *   - The value must contain a fully qualified binary name to the class followed by :: and a field name.
   *   - The field must be static.
   *   - The type of the field must be assignable from the field's class.
   *   - Example: example.mod.MainModClass::THE_INSTANCE
   *   - If there is ambiguity with a method's name, an exception will be thrown.
   * - A method inside of a class.
   *   - The value must contain a fully qualified binary name to the class followed by :: and a method name.
   *   - The method must be capable to implement the entrypoint type as a method reference. Generally this means classes which are functional interfaces.
   *   - Constructor requirement varies based on the method being static or instance level:
   *     - A static method does not require a public no-argument constructor.
   *     - An instance method requires a public no-argument constructor.
   *   - Example: example.mod.MainModClass::init
   *   - If there is ambiguity with a fields's name or other method, an exception will be thrown.
