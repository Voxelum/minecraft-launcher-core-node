 * Defines the JVM opcodes, access flags and array type codes. This interface
 * does not define all the JVM opcodes because some opcodes are automatically
 * handled. For example, the xLOAD and xSTORE opcodes are automatically replaced
 * by xLOAD_n and xSTORE_n opcodes when possible. The xLOAD_n and xSTORE_n
 * opcodes are therefore not defined in this interface. Likewise for LDC,
 * automatically replaced by LDC_W or LDC2_W when necessary, WIDE, GOTO_W and
 * JSR_W.
